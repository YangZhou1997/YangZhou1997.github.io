## About

I am a PostDoc at UC Berkeley advised by [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/). I have equal interests in core systems and ML systems research, including efficient machine learning, datacenter far memory, distributed transactions and consensus, and networking stack designs. [Short Bio](./bio.txt).

<span style="color:red;">I will be joining UC Davis CS as an Assistant Professor, starting July 2025.</span>

I have multiple PhD openings at UC Davis (apply [here](https://apply.grad.ucdavis.edu/apply/) by Dec 15, 2024). Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested. 
* UC Davis is ranked 28th in Best National University and 36th in Best Computer Science Schools by US News. 
* UC Davis has a great location: 20min drive from Sacramento (capital of California) and 1.5h from Silicon Valley (Google, Meta, Amazon).
* Perhaps more importantly, it is a 50min drive from the famous Napa Valley (wine) and 2h from the great Lake Tahoe (skiing and more!).

I finished my PhD in Computer Science at Harvard University in 2024, advised by [Minlan Yu](http://minlanyu.seas.harvard.edu/) and [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu/).
I received my B.S. in Computer Science at Peking University in 2018, advised by [Tong Yang](https://yangtonghome.github.io/) on probabilistic data structures and streaming algorithms.
I was supported by a Google PhD Fellowship in Systems and Networking (see my [application materials](./materials/google_fellowship_cv_rs.pdf)).
